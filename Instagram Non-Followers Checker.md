Instagram Non-Followers Checker This Python script helps you find out:

Who does not follow you back on Instagram.

Who you do not follow back.

🔧 How It Works The script compares your Instagram followers and following lists using JSON data files you can download from your Instagram account.

📁 Requirements Python 3.x

A code editor like VSCode (recommended)

📥 Getting Started Download your Instagram data from your account settings:

Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Data Download on Instagram.

Request your data in JSON format.

After receiving the email from Instagram, download and unzip the data.

Locate the following files in your Instagram data folder:

followers.json

following.json

Place these two files in the same folder as the Python script.

Run the script using your terminal or code editor:

bash Copy Edit python check_nonfollowers.py ✅ Output A list of users who don’t follow you back

A list of users you don’t follow back

📌 Notes Make sure you use the most recent version of your followers/following data.

Keep your Instagram data private and secure.
